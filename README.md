# Nested Empty Folder Cleaner

The Nested Empty Folder Cleaner is a PowerShell script for decluttering file systems by removing all empty folders, including nested ones. It efficiently identifies and deletes empty directories, ensuring a clean and organized file structure, suitable for managing large data volumes.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Deletion**: Capable of removing not only standalone empty folders but also those containing nested empty subfolders.
- **User Interaction**: Prompts the user for the directory path to be cleaned, requiring confirmation to proceed with the deletion process.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visual display of the deletion progress through a secondary script.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging of the operation, including start and end times, total folders evaluated, and specifics of each folder deletion.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have:
- PowerShell 5.1 or higher installed on your system.
- Necessary permissions to access and modify the folders you wish to evaluate and potentially delete.

## Installation

Follow these steps to prepare the script for execution:

1. Download the script files `RemoveEmptyFolderScript.ps1` and `ProgressDisplayScript.ps1` to your preferred location on your machine.
2. Ensure both scripts are saved in the same directory for them to interact properly.

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following steps:

1. Open a PowerShell prompt with administrative privileges.
2. Change your directory (`cd`) to where the scripts are located.
3. Launch the script by entering:
    ```powershell
    .\RemoveEmptyFolderScript.ps1
    ```
4. When prompted, input the full path of the root directory you wish to clean up from empty folders.
5. Confirm your input by typing `y` to start the deletion process or `n` to cancel.

### Operational Flow

- The script initiates by asking for the root path to check and for user confirmation to proceed.
- It sets up a logging system and a progress display script to track and report the operation's progress in real time.
- The main functionality involves recursively checking each folder and its subfolders to identify and remove those without any files.
- Post-operation, it logs a summary of the actions taken, including the total number of folders processed and deleted, and then cleanly exits by closing the progress display and deleting temporary files.

## Logging

The operation generates logs within a `logs` directory situated in the script's running location. Each log file is named after the operation's start date and time, facilitating easy identification and review. Logs detail the deletion of empty folders and provide a summary of the operation for record-keeping purposes.
